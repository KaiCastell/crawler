# crawler
This contains the files from my discord bot, crawler, coded in Python 3.6.11, intended as a text-based roguelike game.

Currently it uses the bot nearly only for the capability of multiplayer, and tends to skim the surface of the API only using what is necessary to have an online terminal, so to speak.

Future goals include an incorporated machine learning algorithm either for the AI enemy or as part of the map generation. 

In order to utilize this bot, you can use the mainOffline file to run the code, but the main file needs a .env file with a corresponding token ID that you create yourself.
