This contains the files from my discord bot, crawler, coded in Python 3.6.11

From "Final Changes for 11/19/2023"
  Currently attempting a move function via the actions.py file. Conditions, actions, and mutators are effectively empty. Maps is still filler.     Playerlist needs edits to adopt the use of mutators to read in players properly (right now it is filler)

From 11/25/2023
  Changed actions to a overrideable function in the entity class. May be annoying (or not) when I make interactables that do not do attacking or moving an entity but will be solved in the future.
