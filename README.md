  Changed actions to a overrideable function in the entity class. May be annoying (or not) when I make interactables that do not do attacking or moving an entity but will be solved in the future. Now planning edits to create enemy to begin testing attack action. After attack action is startup cleanup and room creation.

  Move function is now complete, put in actions.py

  Currently attempting a move function via the actions.py file. Conditions, actions, and mutators are effectively empty. Maps is still filler. Playerlist needs edits to adopt the use of mutators to read in players properly (right now it is filler)
